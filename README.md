### Product Name: Recollab

### Objective: 
Develop a blockchain-based collaboration platform for researchers that facilitate secure and efficient collaboration among researchers by providing a platform for sharing data, findings, and resources while ensuring data integrity and copyright protection.

### Problem Statement
Researchers often face challenges in sharing and collaborating on projects across different institutions due to geographical barriers, data privacy concerns, and lack of a decentralized platform for sharing findings. Recollab aims to address these issues by providing a secure and efficient environment for researchers to connect, share, and collaborate. 

### Proposed Solution
Recollab leverages blockchain technology to provide a decentralized, secure, and transparent environment for researchers to collaborate, share data, and receive feedback. Key features include user onboarding through various authentication methods, profile management, project creation, a dashboard for research proposals, and collaboration tools. Recollab provides increased visibility for research projects and access to a diverse pool of collaborators and reviewers. Recollab is for researchers to:
* Create and manage research projects
* Find collaborators or reviewers
* Share data, findings, and resources securely
* Protect intellectual property
* Target Audience: Researchers across various fields, students, academic institutions, and research organizations.
